2. Usage of React Hooks 
3. Implementation of CRUD Operations
4. Usage of Libraries
5. Testing on Vite, deployment on Vercel

#### React Hooks
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useNavigate
6. useRef

#### Chosen Libraries
1. urlcat - For more concise and accurate URLs
2. MUI - To implement pre-designed components (eg. Accordian)
3. Splide - Display photos as slideshow

### Future Developments
1. Experimenting with local storage to avoid losing information when page is closed/refreshed
2. Refining code with better combination of useState and useReducer
3. Implementation of user-based system
